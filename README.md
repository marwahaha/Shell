# Shell
#### This was an exercise in Unix system calls, with a goal to successfully create a shell which the user could use to call /bin/cat, /bin/ls, /bin/grep/, etc. with pipeline and redirectional abilities.
* pathes to the binaries must be given as commands in the shell
* successful commands are limited, as my scope was intentionally narrow, allowing me to focus on the fundamentals I had yet to learn.
